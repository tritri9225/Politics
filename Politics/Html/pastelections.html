      <div>Looking at past election data is important for understanding trends and predicting future election results. The 2016 presidential election gives us a lot of useful information, especially since two of the candidates are running again for 2020. The democratic candidates need to look at which red states from 2016 they can win over in 2020, and the opposite for republicans. On this page, you will find graphs from 2016 that give insight into how voters may behave in 2020, as well as statistics and information to further comprehend politics in the US.</div>

      <div>This graph shows the total number of votes that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders received in the 2016 primary election. From this graph, we know the total amount of votes, but not which states turned out to be red or blue. The candidates can see approximately how many votes they would need to beat their opponent, but not which states to target for additional support.</div>
